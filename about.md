# CBS Indicator
A simple mod that makes it very obvious someone's using CBS (Click Between Steps)

## What this adds
- An indicator on the top-left that appears when CBS is on
- An indicator on the level endscreen
- Support for CoS

## Why?
With 2.208 adding Click Between Steps (CBS) and Click on Steps (CoS) to the base game, my [CBF Indicator](https://github.com/xblazegmd/cbf-indicator) mod became useless as that mod was made specifically for syzzi's [Click Between Frames](mod:syzzi.click_between_frames) mod, which also became useless. This mod ports the functionality of my CBF Indicator mod to RobTop's CBS and CoS.
