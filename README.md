# CBS Indicator
A simple mod that makes it very obvious someone's using CBS (Click Between Steps)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod was made on commit 21456fc of [Geode SDK](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode) (v5). This mod is not compatible with Geometry Dash 2.2074 or lower.

## Why?
Geometry Dash 2.208 added Click Between Steps (CBS) and Click on Steps (CoS) to the base game. With that addition, my [CBF Indicator](https://github.com/xblazegmd/cbf-indicator) mod became useless as that mod was made specifically for syzzi's [Click Between Frames](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/syzzi.click_between_frames) mod, which also became useless. This mod ports the functionality of my CBF Indicator mod to RobTop's CBS and CoS.
