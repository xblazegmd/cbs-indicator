# Support me
Just you using this mod is already more than I could ever ask for. So I just wanna say: thank you. I'm just a random kid that likes coding and making silly projects like this, and having someone actually care abt the silly projects I make? That's just, wow.

If you really wanted to support me in other ways, I don't have any economic sorta support thing like a Ko-Fi or Patreon, but I do have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2tY605BKdf4K04iTNM_G8w), so you subscribing would be amazing.

Anyways, just, thank you :)
